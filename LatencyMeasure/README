IRQ capable PINs are:

PIN  IRQ  IRQ#
--------------
 3    0   INT0
 2    1   INT1
 0    2   INT2
 1    3   INT3
 7    4   INT6

Build the SW including the current GIT version
==============================================

 - create platform.local.txt
   in your Arduino installation environment
      try: ~/Arduino/arduino/hardware/arduino/avr

recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.1.pattern={build.source.path}/make-git-version.sh "{build.source.path}" "{build.path}"


Reset to Bootloader
===================
If the board can't be flashed resp. the board doesn't appear as a serial device, it might
help to double-reset the board (pull RST two times to GND). The board will stay 8 seconds
in the bootload.
In this state the sketch can be uploaded.
NOTE: it might help first to click upload in the IDE and then do the double RST.
